In the latter\ncase, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output\n(providing more output space) before each call.\n\n  The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is\nthe zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped\naround a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.\n\n  The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format\nwith an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start\nwith \"gz\".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a\ngzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.\n\n  This library can optionally read and write gzip streams in memory as well.\n\n  The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory\nand on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-\nfile compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain\ndirectory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.\n\n  The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks\nthe consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash\neven in case of corrupted input.","declarations":[],"spell":"80:18-80:28|-1|1|2","extent":"80:1-80:71|-1|1|0","alias_of":0,"bases":[],"derived":[],"types":[],"funcs":[],"vars":[],"instances":[8],"uses":["80:18-80:28|-1|1|4","97:5-97:15|-1|1|4"]},{"id":2,"usr":2994182817072168041,"detailed_name":"uInt","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":4,"kind":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"bases":[],"derived":[],"types":[],"funcs":[],"vars":[],"instances":[1,4,19,20,22,24],"uses":["80:49-80:53|-1|1|4","80:61-80:65|-1|1|4","87:5-87:9|-1|1|4","91:5-91:9|-1|1|4","118:5-118:9|-1|1|4","119:5-119:9|-1|1|4","121:5-121:9|-1|1|4","123:5-123:9|-1|1|4","589:46-589:50|-1|1|4","821:46-821:50|-1|1|4","844:46-844:50|-1|1|4","1569:66-1569:70|-1|1|4","1600:64-1600:68|-1|1|4"]},{"id":3,"usr":13838176792705659279,"detailed_name":"<fundamental>","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"kind":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"bases":[],"derived":[],"types":[],"funcs":[],"vars":[],"instances":[],"uses":[]},{"id":4,"usr":876589351024196228,"detailed_name":"free_func","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":9,"kind":252,"hover":"typedef

If not all input can be processed (because there is not\n  enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and\n  processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().\n\n- Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out\n  accordingly.  This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.\n  Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter\n  should be set only when necessary (in interactive applications).  Some\n  output may be provided even if flush is not set.\n\n  Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least\none of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more\noutput, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out should\nnever be zero before the call.  The application can consume the compressed\noutput when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full (avail_out\n== 0), or after each call of deflate().  If deflate returns Z_OK and with\nzero avail_out, it must be called again after making room in the output\nbuffer because there might be more output pending.\n\n  Normally the parameter flush is set to Z_NO_FLUSH, which allows deflate to\ndecide how much data to accumulate before producing output, in order to\nmaximize compression.\n\n  If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, all pending output is\nflushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so\nthat the decompressor can get all input data available so far.  (In\nparticular avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been\nprovided before the call.) Flushing may degrade compression for some\ncompression algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.  This\ncompletes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty stored block\nthat is three bits plus filler bits to the next byte, followed by four bytes\n(00 00 ff ff).\n\n  If flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, all pending output is flushed to the\noutput buffer, but the output is not aligned to a byte boundary.  All of the\ninput data so far will be available to the decompressor, as for Z_SYNC_FLUSH.\nThis completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty fixed\ncodes block that is 10 bits long.  This assures that enough bytes are output\nin order for the decompressor to finish the block before the empty fixed code\nblock.\n\n  If flush is set to Z_BLOCK, a deflate block is completed and emitted, as\nfor Z_SYNC_FLUSH, but the output is not aligned on a byte boundary, and up to\nseven bits of the current block are held to be written as the next byte after\nthe next deflate block is completed.  In this case, the decompressor may not\nbe provided enough bits at this point in order to complete decompression of\nthe data provided so far to the compressor.  It may need to wait for the next\nblock to be emitted.  This is for advanced applications that need to control\nthe emission of deflate blocks.\n\n  If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with\nZ_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can\nrestart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if\nrandom access is desired.  Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade\ncompression.\n\n  If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again\nwith the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated\navail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero\navail_out).  In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that\navail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to\navail_out == 0 on return.\n\n  If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed,\npending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was\nenough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be\ncalled again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no\nmore input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error.  After\ndeflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the stream\nare deflateReset or deflateEnd.\n\n  Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression\nis to be done in a single step.

Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much\noutput as possible to the output buffer.  Z_BLOCK requests that inflate()\nstop if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary.  When decoding\nthe zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately\nafter the header and before the first block.  When doing a raw inflate,\ninflate() will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it\ngets to the end of that block, or when it runs out of data.\n\n  The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.\nAlso to assist in this, on return inflate() will set strm->data_type to the\nnumber of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm->next_in, plus 64 if\ninflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream, plus\n128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block code or\ndecoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the deflate\nstream.  The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the uncompressed\ndata from that block has been written to strm->next_out.  The number of\nunused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when bit 7 of\ndata_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be less than\neight.  data_type is set as noted here every time inflate() returns for all\nflush options, and so can be used to determine the amount of currently\nconsumed input in bits.\n\n  The Z_TREES option behaves as Z_BLOCK does, but it also returns when the\nend of each deflate block header is reached, before any actual data in that\nblock is decoded.  This allows the caller to determine the length of the\ndeflate block header for later use in random access within a deflate block.\n256 is added to the value of strm->data_type when inflate() returns\nimmediately after reaching the end of the deflate block header.\n\n  inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an\nerror.  However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step (a\nsingle call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to Z_FINISH.  In\nthis case all pending input is processed and all pending output is flushed;\navail_out must be large enough to hold all of the uncompressed data for the\noperation to complete.  (The size of the uncompressed data may have been\nsaved by the compressor for this purpose.) The use of Z_FINISH is not\nrequired to perform an inflation in one step.  However it may be used to\ninform inflate that a faster approach can be used for the single inflate()\ncall.  Z_FINISH also informs inflate to not maintain a sliding window if the\nstream completes, which reduces inflate's memory footprint.  If the stream\ndoes not complete, either because not all of the stream is provided or not\nenough output space is provided, then a sliding window will be allocated and\ninflate() can be called again to continue the operation as if Z_NO_FLUSH had\nbeen used.\n\n   In this implementation, inflate() always flushes as much output as\npossible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the\nfirst call.  So the effects of the flush parameter in this implementation are\non the return value of inflate() as noted below, when inflate() returns early\nwhen Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES is used, and when inflate() avoids the allocation of\nmemory for a sliding window when Z_FINISH is used.\n\n   If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary\nbelow), inflate sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of the dictionary\nchosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets\nstrm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,\ntotal_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described\nbelow.  At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed adler32\nchecksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END\nonly if the checksum is correct.\n\n  inflate() can decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped\ndeflate data.  The header type is detected automatically, if requested when\ninitializing with inflateInit2().  Any information contained in the gzip\nheader is not retained, so applications that need that information should\ninstead use raw inflate, see inflateInit2() below, or inflateBack() and\nperform their own processing of the gzip header and trailer.  When processing\ngzip-wrapped deflate data, strm->adler32 is set to the CRC-32 of the output\nproducted so far.  The CRC-32 is checked against the gzip trailer.\n\n  inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed\nor more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has\nbeen reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a\npreset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was\ncorrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect check\nvalue), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example\nnext_in or next_out was Z_NULL), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory,\nZ_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible or if there was not enough room in the\noutput buffer when Z_FINISH is used.  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and\ninflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to\ncontinue decompressing.

This is potentially more efficient than\n inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the\n output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output\n buffer.  inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large\n buffers.  inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output\n buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns.\n\n   inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state\n and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.\n inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw\n deflate stream with each call.  inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the\n allocated state.\n\n   A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.\n This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip\n files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the\n header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only\n the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the normal\n behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and\n trailer around the deflate stream.\n\n   inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then\n called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those\n routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the\n uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's\n parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func\n typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the\n number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If\n there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that\n case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will call\n out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1].  out()\n should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out() returns\n non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor out()\n are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to\n inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.\n The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero\n amount of input may be provided by in().\n\n   For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by\n setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then\n in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before\n calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called\n immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in\n must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will\n initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 ..  strm->avail_in - 1].\n\n   The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the\n first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These\n descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-\n supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.\n\n   On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to\n pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The\n return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR\n if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error\n in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature\n of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized.\n In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished\n using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error.
