MidiParser \n@brief Parse a midi file for the sake of multithreading playing\n\nMidi files are composed of midi events such as note on and note off. The midifile library\nparses the file and extracts these messages into objects. The goals of TSAL are to \naudiolize multithreading with sound. One example is processing a midi file. Instead of using different\ntracks, TSAL overlays sound with multiple threads by reading different portions of a midi file.\nIf a midi file is prepared with this process in mind, one track can contain multiple parts by\npartitioning equally across the length of the track. To make the use of this concept more felxible, \nMidiParser ensures that the number of midi events are equally distributed so that this process can\nbe easily performed. It simply adds useless midi events where necessary based upon the number of
