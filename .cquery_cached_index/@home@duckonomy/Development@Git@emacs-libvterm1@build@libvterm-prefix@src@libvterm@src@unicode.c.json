Interoperability between terminal-line\n applications and (teletype-style) character terminals using the\n UTF-8 encoding requires agreement on which character should advance\n the cursor by how many cell positions. No established formal\n standards exist at present on which Unicode character shall occupy\n how many cell positions on character terminals. These routines are\n a first attempt of defining such behavior based on simple rules\n applied to data provided by the Unicode Consortium.\n\n For some graphical characters, the Unicode standard explicitly\n defines a character-cell width via the definition of the East Asian\n FullWidth (F), Wide (W), Half-width (H), and Narrow (Na) classes.\n In all these cases, there is no ambiguity about which width a\n terminal shall use. For characters in the East Asian Ambiguous (A)\n class, the width choice depends purely on a preference of backward\n compatibility with either historic CJK or Western practice.\n Choosing single-width for these characters is easy to justify as\n the appropriate long-term solution, as the CJK practice of\n displaying these characters as double-width comes from historic\n implementation simplicity (8-bit encoded characters were displayed\n single-width and 16-bit ones double-width, even for Greek,\n Cyrillic, etc.) and not any typographic considerations.\n\n Much less clear is the choice of width for the Not East Asian\n (Neutral) class. Existing practice does not dictate a width for any\n of these characters. It would nevertheless make sense\n typographically to allocate two character cells to characters such\n as for instance EM SPACE or VOLUME INTEGRAL, which cannot be\n represented adequately with a single-width glyph. The following\n routines at present merely assign a single-cell width to all\n neutral characters, in the interest of simplicity. This is not\n entirely satisfactory and should be reconsidered before\n establishing a formal standard in this area. At the moment, the\n decision which Not East Asian (Neutral) characters should be\n represented by double-width glyphs cannot yet be answered by\n applying a simple rule from the Unicode database content. Setting\n up a proper standard for the behavior of UTF-8 character terminals\n will require a careful analysis not only of each Unicode character,\n but also of each presentation form, something the author of these\n routines has avoided to do so far.\n\n http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr11/\n\n Markus Kuhn -- 2007-05-26 (Unicode 5.0)\n\n Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software\n for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted.
