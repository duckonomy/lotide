Thus, any\nverses that are not in the chosen versification (v11n) follow those that are.\n\nThe prior implementation of this adjusted the verse to the last one that is in the chosen v11n.\nIf it the chapter were extra, then it is appended to the last verse of the last\nchapter in the chosen v11n for that book. If it is just extra verses for a chapter, then it is\nappended to the last verse of the chapter.\n\nThe problem with this is when a OSIS verse refers to more than one verse, e.g.\nosisID=\"Gen.1.29 Gen.1.30 Gen.1.31\" (Gen.1.31 is the last verse of the chapter in the chosen v11n)\nand then it is followed by Gen.1.32.\n\nThis routine assumes that linking is postponed to the end so that in the example Gen.1.30-31\nare not linked but rather empty. This routine will then find the last verse in the computed\nchapter that has content.\n\nAlternative, we could have done linking as we went, but this routine would have needed\nto find the first entry in the link set and elsewhere in the code when appending to a\nverse, it would need to be checked for adjacent links and those would have needed to be adjusted.\n\nparam key the key that may need to be adjusted","declarations":[],"spell":"432:6-432:18|-1|1|2","extent":"432:1-480:2|-1|1|0","bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[53,54,55,56],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":8,"usr":4884130227551542025,"detailed_name":"void writeEntry(int &text, bool force = false)","short_name_offset":5,"short_name_size":10,"kind":12,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"482:6-482:16|-1|1|2","extent":"482:1-592:2|-1|1|0","bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":9,"usr":15894248137035092551,"detailed_name":"void linkToEntry(int &linkKey, int &dest)","short_name_offset":5,"short_name_size":11,"kind":12,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"594:6-594:17|-1|1|2","extent":"594:1-612:2|-1|1|0","bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[68,69,70],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":10,"usr":8696940849874877654,"detailed_name":"bool handleToken(int &text, int token)","short_name_offset":5,"short_name_size":11,"kind":12,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"Return true if the content was handled or is to be ignored.\n       false if the what has been seen is to be accumulated and considered later.","declarations":[],"spell":"616:6-616:17|-1|1|2","extent":"616:1-1201:2|-1|1|0","bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108],"uses":[],"callees":["813:6-813:13|11|3|36","996:5-996:12|11|3|36","1015:4-1015:8|12|3|36"]},{"id":11,"usr":2544375653554166760,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"kind":0,"storage":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":["813:6-813:13|10|3|36","996:5-996:12|10|3|36","1236:4-1236:11|13|3|36","1260:4-1260:11|13|3|36"],"callees":[]},{"id":12,"usr":15671729554883229445,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"kind":0,"storage":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":["1015:4-1015:8|10|3|36","1425:2-1425:6|15|3|36","1587:6-1587:10|17|3|36","1744:6-1744:10|17|3|36","1788:6-1788:10|17|3|36","2016:6-2016:10|21|3|36","2022:6-2022:10|21|3|36","2029:5-2029:9|21|3|36","2035:5-2035:9|21|3|36","2118:3-2118:7|21|3|36","2131:4-2131:8|21|3|36","2146:2-2146:6|21|3|36"],"callees":[]},{"id":13,"usr":2527163785324884235,"detailed_name":"int transformBSP(int t)","short_name_offset":4,"short_name_size":12,"kind":12,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"\nSupport normalizations necessary for a SWORD module.\nOSIS allows for document structure (Book, Section, Paragraph or BSP)\nto overlap Bible versification (Book, Chapter, Verse).\nMost SWORD applications need to display verses in isolation or in HTML table cells,\nrequiring each stored entry (i.e. verses) to be well-formed xml.\nThis routine normalizes container elements which could cross verse boundaries into milestones.\nFor most of these OSIS elements, there is a milestone form.
